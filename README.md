## Overview
This repository contains the code used in our study combining complex network analysis and machine learning techniques to investigate EEG brain activity under the influence of ayahuasca.

## Input Data
The dataset used in this study consists of EEG recordings obtained from subjects before and after ayahuasca ingestion. Connectivity matrices were derived from the EEG signals and used to compute network measures.

> üìÅ The data is publicly available and is described in detail in the **Materials and Methods** section of the paper.
